# Abstract 


A purely  ```peer-to-peer``` version of electronic cash would allow   
online payments to be sent directly from one party to another   
without going through a financial institution.



```Digital signatures``` provide part of the solution   
But, the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending  


We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.  

The network ```timestamps``` transactions by hashing them
 into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work
forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the ```proof-of-work```


The longest chain not only serves as proof of the ```sequence of events witnessed```
but also  proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power


As long as a ```majority of CPU power``` is controlled by nodes  
that are not cooperating to attact the network  
They will generate the longest chain and outpace attackers.  



The network itself requires minimal structure  


Messages are broadcaast on a best effort basis  
And nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will,  
accepting the longest proof-of-work chain   
as ```proof of what happened``` while they were gone.  






# peer-to-peer

A Network dosen't need third party like bank



# Digital signatures
Digital signature shows who sent the message and money.  
The sender makes a digital signature with their private key.



# double-spending
 It means spend money twice at once on digital world  
 like  A send money B and then copy the money and send money to C 

# timestamps 
The time that shows when block was created 



# proof of work 
complex math problem that needs to be solved when a block is created.



# sequence of events witnessed
 sequence of transactions through all of node 




# majority of CPU power
  * To create a block, you need to solve a hash puzzle.
  * That's the amount of electricity used to solve that puzzle.


# proof of what happened

proof of what happened :  proof of some transaction
