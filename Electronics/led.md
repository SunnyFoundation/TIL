What Is LED?

LED is light Emitting Diode

It is literally a diode that can emit light.

then What is diode?

Diode is electron component that  electricity can flow only one way 

so LED is LIGHT EMITTING DIODE 

If you guys curious How is led can emit light? 

P-Type semiconductor is semiconductor that has a hole 

because it has hole therefore electron can flow easily 

N-Type semiconductor is semiconductor that has a more Electron

because it has a more Electron therefore Electron can flow easily 

And Now combination P-type and N-type and then light energy came from there 

So LED is light On
