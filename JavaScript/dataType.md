# Understanding Data Types in JavaScript

You know what a type is. For example:

- **She is the type who has long hair.**
- **He is the type who has tall height.**

JavaScript has types too!

## Data Types

### Number
```javascript
let age = 25; // age is number type because you put 25 to age
```

### String
```javascript
let name = "Sun"; // name is string type because you put "Sun" to name
```

### Boolean
```javascript
let man = true;  // man is true because I am a man
let woman = false; // woman is false because I am a man
```

### Null
```javascript
let empty = null; // empty is null type that nothing have
```

### Undefined
```javascript
let curious; // curious is undefined type
```

## Difference Between `null` and `undefined`

- **Null**: Can be used when you do not want to assign a data type to a variable.
- **Undefined**: Happens when you forget to put data in a variable. The compiler assigns it as `undefined`.
